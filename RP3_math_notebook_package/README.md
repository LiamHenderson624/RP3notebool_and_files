# RP3 Math Notebook (Energy Resource Modelling)

This notebook involves a supply and demand analysis of Corner Brook, N.L., in the context of pre-existing RNG generation technology.

To see this notebook, run `RP3_Math_Energy_Notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter/VSCode/PyCharm; all data found in `data/`. Keep the notebook and `data/` folder together. All calculations can be found in Excel spreadsheet in notebook folder.

Displayed are Fermentation and Nuclear Fission segments for Phase 1, as well as an expanded analysis of RNG supply versus demand for a neighbourhood and for the entirety of Corner Brook, N.L.
The supply of both technologies are projected, with a nuclear fission plot and a predicted vs. actual plot of RNG output. The second phase involves generating a top demand profile for both Bannister's Road neighbourhood and 25% Corner Brook, along with projecting energy storage and hours of coverage.
